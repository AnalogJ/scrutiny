# Testers

Scrutiny supports many operating systems, CPU architectures and runtime environments. Unfortunately that makes it incredibly
difficult to test. 
Thankfully the following users have been gracious enough to test/validate Scrutiny works on their system.

> NOTE: If you're interested in volunteering to test Scrutiny beta builds on your system, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/issues).
