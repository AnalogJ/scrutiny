# S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring with Scrutiny across machines

![drawing-3-1671744407](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86809766/209230023-bf1ef9f8-65c4-454e-9e1a-be1293cd737e.png)

### 🤔 The problem:

Scrutiny offers a nice Docker package called "Omnibus" that can monitor HDDs attached to a Docker host with relative
ease. Scrutiny can also be installed in a Hub-Spoke layout where Web interface, Database and Collector come in 3
separate packages. The official documentation assumes that the spokes in the "Hub-Spokes layout" run Docker, which is
not always the case. The third approach is to install Scrutiny manually, entirely outside of Docker.

### 💡 The solution:

This tutorial provides a hybrid configuration where the Hub lives in a Docker instance while the spokes have only
Scrutiny Collector installed manually. The Collector periodically send data to the Hub. It's not mind-boggling hard to
understand but someone might struggle with the setup. This is for them.

### 🖥️ My setup:

I have a Proxmox cluster where one VM runs Docker and all monitoring services - Grafana, Prometheus, various exporters,
InfluxDB and so forth. Another VM runs the NAS - OpenMediaVault v6, where all hard drives reside. The Scrutiny Collector
is triggered every 30min to collect data on the drives. The data is sent to the Docker VM, running InfluxDB.

## Setting up the Hub

![drawing-3-1671744714](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86809766/209230113-c954d834-521b-4555-bcd2-eb6b80f343be.png)

The Hub consists of Scrutiny Web - a web interface for viewing the SMART data. And InfluxDB, where the smartmon data is
stored.

[🔗This is the official Hub-Spoke layout in docker-compose.](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/blob/master/docker/example.hubspoke.docker-compose.yml)
We are going to reuse parts of it. The ENV variables provide the necessary configuration for the initial setup, both for
InfluxDB and Scrutiny.

If you are working with and existing InfluxDB instance, you can forgo all the `INIT` variables as they already exist.

The official Scrutiny documentation has a
sample [scrutiny.yaml ](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/blob/master/example.scrutiny.yaml)file that normally
contains the connection and notification details but I always find it easier to configure as much as possible in the
docker-compose.

```yaml
networks:
  monitoring: # A common network for all monitoring services to communicate into
    external: true # Not needed if only running locally
  notifications: # To Gotify or another Notification service
    external: true # Not needed if only running locally

services:
  influxdb:
    container_name: influxdb
    image: influxdb:2.7-alpine
    ports:
      - 8086:8086
    volumes:
      - ${DIR_CONFIG}/influxdb2/db:/var/lib/influxdb2
      - ${DIR_CONFIG}/influxdb2/config:/etc/influxdb2
    environment:
      - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup
      - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=Admin
      - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD}
      - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=homelab
      - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=scrutiny
      - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=SUPERSECRETPASSWORD
      - TZ=Europe/Stockholm
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - monitoring
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8086/health"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 20

  scrutiny:
    container_name: scrutiny
    image: ghcr.io/analogj/scrutiny:master-web
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - ${DIR_CONFIG}/config:/opt/scrutiny/config
    environment:
      - SCRUTINY_WEB_INFLUXDB_HOST=influxdb
      - SCRUTINY_WEB_INFLUXDB_PORT=8086
      - SCRUTINY_WEB_INFLUXDB_TOKEN=SUPERSECRETPASSWORD
      - SCRUTINY_WEB_INFLUXDB_ORG=homelab
      - SCRUTINY_WEB_INFLUXDB_BUCKET=scrutiny
      # Optional but highly recommended to notify you in case of a problem
      - SCRUTINY_NOTIFY_URLS=[SEE EXAMPLES HERE: https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/blob/master/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_NOTIFICATIONS.md ]
      - TZ=Europe/Stockholm
    depends_on:
      influxdb:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - notifications
      - monitoring
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/api/health"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 20
      start_period: 10s

```

A freshly initialized Scrutiny instance can be accessed on port 8080, eg. `192.168.0.100:8080`. The interface will be
empty because no metrics have been collected yet.

## Setting up a Spoke ***without*** Docker

![drawing-3-1671744208](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86809766/209230155-386a8644-b506-497f-8245-0d24e15c9063.png)

A spoke consists of the Scrutiny Collector binary that is run on a set interval via crontab and sends the data to the
Hub. The official
documentation [describes the manual setup of the Collector](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_MANUAL.md#collector)
- dependencies and step by step commands. I have a shortened version that does the same thing but in one line of code.

```bash
# Installing dependencies
apt install smartmontools -y 

# 1. Create directory for the binary
# 2. Download the binary into that directory
# 3. Make it exacutable
# 4. List the contents of the library for confirmation
mkdir -p /opt/scrutiny/bin && \
curl -L https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/releases/download/v0.8.1/scrutiny-collector-metrics-linux-amd64 > /opt/scrutiny/bin/scrutiny-collector-metrics-linux-amd64 && \
chmod +x /opt/scrutiny/bin/scrutiny-collector-metrics-linux-amd64 && \
ls -lha /opt/scrutiny/bin
```

<p class="callout warning">When downloading Github Release Assests, make sure that you have the correct version. The provided example is with Release v0.5.0. [The release list can be found here.](https://github.com/analogj/scrutiny/releases) </p>

Once the Collector is installed, you can run it with the following command. Make sure to add the correct address and
port of your Hub as `--api-endpoint`.

```bash
/opt/scrutiny/bin/scrutiny-collector-metrics-linux-amd64 run --api-endpoint "http://192.168.0.100:8080"
```

This will run the Collector once and populate the Web interface of your Scrutiny instance. In order to collect metrics
for a time series, you need to run the command repeatedly. Here is an example for crontab, running the Collector every
15min.

```bash
# open crontab
crontab -e

# add a line for Scrutiny
*/15 * * * * /opt/scrutiny/bin/scrutiny-collector-metrics-linux-amd64 run --api-endpoint "http://192.168.0.100:8080"
```

The Collector has its own independent config file that lives in `/opt/scrutiny/config/collector.yaml` but I did not find
a need to modify
it. [A default collector.yaml can be found in the official documentation.](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/blob/master/example.collector.yaml)

## Setting up a Spoke ***with*** Docker

![drawing-3-1671744277](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86809766/209230176-87c9e55a-4e3e-4f5f-9609-335d41529f3d.png)

Setting up a remote Spoke in Docker requires you to split
the [official Hub-Spoke layout docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny/blob/master/docker/example.hubspoke.docker-compose.yml)
. In the following docker-compose you need to provide the `${API_ENDPOINT}`, in my case `http://192.168.0.100:8080`.
Also all drives that you wish to monitor need to be presented to the container under `devices`.

The image handles the periodic scanning of the drives.

```yaml
services:

  collector:
    image: 'ghcr.io/analogj/scrutiny:master-collector'
    cap_add:
      - SYS_RAWIO
    volumes:
      - '/run/udev:/run/udev:ro'
    environment:
      COLLECTOR_API_ENDPOINT: ${API_ENDPOINT}
    devices:
      - "/dev/sda"
      - "/dev/sdb"
```
