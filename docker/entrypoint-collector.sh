# Cron runs in its own isolated environment (usually using only /etc/environment )
# So when the container starts up, we will do a dump of the runtime environment into a .env file that we
# will then source into the crontab file (/etc/cron.d/scrutiny.sh)

printenv | sed 's/^\(.*\)$/export \1/g' > /env.sh

# now that we have the env start cron in the foreground
echo "starting cron"
cron -f
